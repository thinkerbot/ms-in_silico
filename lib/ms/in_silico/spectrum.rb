    #   [N] is the molecular mass of the neutral N-terminal group, [C] is the
    #   molecular mass of the neutral C-terminal group, [M] is molecular mass
    #   of the neutral amino acid residues. To obtain m/z values, add or 
    #   subtract protons as required to obtain the required charge and divide
    #   by the number of charges. For example, to get a+, add 1 proton to the
    #   Mr value for a.  To get a--, subtract 2 protons from the Mr value for
    #   a and divide by 2.

    #    a°        a-H2O

    # ==== Use of alternate masses
    # By default a Spectrum will calculate the ion series' using the
    # monoisotopic masses for each element.  To calculate masses
    # differently, provide a block to new; each Element will be
    # passed to the block as needed, and the block should return
    # the element mass used in the calculation.
    #
    # Alternatively, a subclass can override the mass method; all
    # objects that need to be turned into a mass (nterm, cterm, 
    # a variety of molecules specified as strings, the elements,
    # ELECTRON, etc) are passed to mass to yield the value used
    # in any given calculation.
    #
